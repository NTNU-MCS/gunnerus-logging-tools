## MQTT server for incoming messages
# "mosquitto" is the name of the docker container. Keep it mosquitto if you want
#   to run the docker-compose file as is.
# "localhost" if you want to run the docker-compose file with the --net=host
#   option. Or running it without docker.

## Custom MQTT topics to subscribe to
# The topics are used to filter out messages from the MQTT broker.
# Even though they are defined as configuration, they are not used as such.
# Do not modify it unless the message types changes for RV Gunnerus.

    "gunnerus/NMEA/#",
